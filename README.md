strategicHR
===========
StrategicHR is an elearning environment where visitors browse and search for courses, and registered users can take courses and receive certification. Each course consists of a video and a quiz.  After watching the complete video, and passing the quiz, users can optionally pay to receive a certificate for passing the course.  

The videos are approximately one hour long, and users must watch the entire video, and pass the quiz, in order to pass the course.

The quizzes are graded as pass/fail only.  Every question on a quiz is a multiple-choice question.  Each quiz might consist of 25 total questions, but users are only asked to answer a random subset of 15 of those questions each time they take the quiz.  The default passing score is 80% correct. Quizzes can be taken as many times as desired.

The videos and quizzes are free, but users must register in order to be able to watch a video and take a quiz.  Once a user has watched the entire video, and passed the quiz, then they have successfully completed the course.  After completing a course, if the user wants a certificate for the class (which typically qualifies them for some type of credit), then they will pay a processing fee.  The default processing fee is $39.99.

Users who are not registered can browse all of the courses, but they cannot watch the videos or take the quizzes.   Registered Users can see the status of their courses, including:  which courses they’ve completed, which they haven’t, and which ones they’ve received certificates for.
