my certificates page

  As a user
  I can see the my certificates page

  Scenario:
    Given I am a user
    When I go to my certificates page
    I see links to all my certificates that I've ordered
    I see the date and time that the certificates were ordered along with the price
    I see links to order certificates for eligible courses that I've completed
